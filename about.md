Out of curiosity and for self-improvement, I like to experiment my hypotheses on seemingly petty and yet fascinating phenomena and challenge myself learning new technologies by blogging and building side projects using various tools. I am constantly evolving my interests to pursue a career in Data Science.

My current interests lie in the intersection of data science and logistics/transportation.
