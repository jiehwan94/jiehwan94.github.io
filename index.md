# About

<!--author-->

<br>

---
A returning senior from military service majoring in MIS and minoring in Business Analytics, Computer Science, and Statistics ✏️✒️

I am constantly evolving my studies and work experience to pursue a career in Data Analytics.

Out of curiosity and for self-improvement, I like to experiment my hypotheses on seemingly petty and yet fascinating phenomena and challenge myself learning new technologies by blogging and building side projects using various tools.

 I named my blog "Connecting Dots" because I thought posting the dots I draw everyday on my blog will make a fun story as a whole 💡

My interests lie in:

>  Machine Learning, Dogs, Soccer

Please refer to my [CV](/public/Yang_Jiehwan_Resume.pdf) 😃
