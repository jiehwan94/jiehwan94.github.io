# 3PL: Terminologies

Types of Parties
- Carriers
- Brokers
- Shippers

Types of Trucks
- Van
- Flatbed

- Reefer
    - refrigerated container 



Back-haul vs. Front-haul vs. Over-haul
- Back-haul
    - return trip back from the original destination point to the point of origin
    - Utilizing the backhaul saves time, money, and environmental resources.
- Front-haul
    - origin to destination
- Over-haul
    - 


Dead-head
- has no cargo moved within a trip
- e.g) a truck goes from Nashville to Minneapolis with guitars, but it comes back to Nashville empty; that is a dead-head trip.
- happens because of supply and demand; there might be more demand out of China than bringing more products into China.
- Ideally, products coming out would be equal to products coming in for environmental and financial reasons, but often this is not the case.


FSC (Fuel Surcharge)
- a fuel fee that accounts for the region and the distance traveled
- price of fuel fluctuates => FSC is negotiable


Intermodal vs. Multimodal
- Intermodal
    - I thought it referred to "transportation on rails"?????
    - process of moving cargo between a variety of different transportation methods (freight, air, motor carriers, etc.), but all under the same company.
- Multimodal
    - similar to intermodal in that it moves cargo via multiple methods
    - but under different companies for each provider

Goods in Transit
- products that have been shipped out but haven’t yet been received by the customer
- also called: transit inventory or stock in transit
 
Freight Forwarding firms
- leader in the logistics indstury
- Not 3PL but large companies like DHL that large volumes of goods over land, air, and sea
- combines many goods into large shipments that they can ship for lower rates than competitors
- Their volume allows for them to offer low rates than they could otherwise




## Misc.

Kitting
- when you pre-assemble individual items into ready to ship kits
- great option if you have a top selling order (e.g. your 3 most popular items or a new client gift package) that you ship regularly
- Having your order fulfillment provider kit them upfront will save you time and money in the long-haul.

LIFO vs. FIFO

- LIFO
    - Last In, First Out
    - last products in are the first products shipped out
- FIFO
    - First In, First Out
    - first products to come in to the warehouse, are the first products to be shipped out
- Deciding which you want can affect your product’s quality, especially if it’s food-related


Embargo
- an order to restrict the hauling of cargo
- placed between countries to prohibit exporting or importing in general, or just on a specific product.

Actual Time of Arrival (A.T.A.)
- when a container, cargo, railcar, etc. arrives at a certain point

Cross Docking
- unloading cargo from a truck and then directly loading it out on outbound trucks with almost no warehouse time in between
- great option for clients who want to reduce costs of warehousing and labor, but the timing needs to be right to send out all the products right away

Replenishment
- process of moving products and resources from a secondary warehouse location to the primary warehouse location
- sole mission is to help keep inventory flowing through the supply chain and not skip a beat with the customer’s demands of the product
- Helps keep inventory levels consistent and deliver on client orders in a timely fashion.

Reverse Logistics
- managing and focusing on the logistics of the products after the sale (everything from returns, recycling and repairs, to the management and sale of surplus products)
- About 7% of a company’s gross sales are used up by return costs; from managing returns to getting rid of surplus or expired stock

Pool Distribution
- Nope. Not a distribution of swimming pools! lol
- regular distribution of orders to multiple destinations within a certain geographic region
- goods are shipped to regional centers to be shipped out regularly to smaller local cities and clients
- Instead of making multiple long-haul trips from Oregon to New Hampshire, a company can have a regional pool distribution center in Connecticut for the entire NE seaboard
- cost saving way to make smaller shipments regularly to many clients.
