# How to Avoid Disconnection in Google colab

* toc
{:toc}

Google Colab can disconnect when there's no interaction for 90 minutes which can be prevented by triggering an interaction within 90 minutes.

If you press F12 or Ctrl+shift+i on web browser, a console will pop up.

You can add the following JS code in the console.

~~~JavaScript
function ClickConnect(){
    console.log("Prevent Colab Disconnection");
    document.querySelector("colab-toolbar-button#connect").click()
}
setInterval(ClickConnect, 60 * 1000)
~~~

This will execute the ClickConnect() funcdtion every minute.
