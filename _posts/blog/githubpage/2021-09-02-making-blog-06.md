# [GithubPages] 06.Managing and Comitting Blog Posts

There are many tools that ease up managing (posting, deleting, updating) your blog posts.

I have tried different tools (prose.io, Admin, etc.) and going to introduce two tools: Atom and VS Code plugin.

## 1_ Atom

Download both [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced) package.

Atom allows us to make changes to .md file and check how it changes the web simultaneously.

## 2_ Visual Studio Code

Just like Atom, you can display the same preview with VS Code.
