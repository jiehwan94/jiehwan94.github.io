# [GithubPages] 03. Customize Theme

* toc
{:toc}


Let's start customizing our blog.

Most jekyll themes follow similar structure, so you should be able to apply it to other themes.

Since the objective is to create a blog within a day, I won't describe the nitty-gritty details and start customizing from the folder located at the top.

## 1 _data
---

![그림1](/assets/img/Blog/githubpages/3-1.jpeg)

In the "_data" folder, we just need to change "authors.yml". This is where we set the owner of the blog.

![그림2](/assets/img/Blog/githubpages/3-2.jpeg)

author1 --> Github ID

name : Blogger's Name

email : Blogger's Email

about : Explanation about yourself in the About section

picture: Picture of yourself in the About section

1x refers to the picture on PC

2x refers to picture on Mobile

Let's change the path to "/assets/img/me.jpg"

Then put your me.jpg file in the assets/img folder.

![그림3](/assets/img/Blog/githubpages/3-3.jpeg)

![그림4](/assets/img/Blog/githubpages/3-4.jpeg)

In the social section, we can add our contact information for email, git, facebook, twitter, etc.



## 2 _featured_tags
---
This is where we edit the side-bar information.

![그림6](/assets/img/Blog/githubpages/3-6.jpeg)

In the category, I would want it to have categories in the order of Portfolio, Project, Class, Review, Daily, Travel, Etc

Change the name of "hyde.md" file to "Portfolio.md"

title: Portfolio

slug: portfolio

order: 2

You can create as many .md files as you want in any order of your choice.

## 3 _includes
---
__about.html__

__author.html__

__sidebar.html__ : **Important** You can customize your sidebar here.

Let's put an image in the sidebar.


![그림22](/assets/img/Blog/githubpages/3-22.JPG)

><div class="sidebar-box">
        {% if author.picture %}
          {% include srcset-img.html class="me" img=author.picture alt=author.name %}
        {% endif %}
</div>


## 4 _posts
---
![그림10](/assets/img/Blog/githubpages/3-10.jpeg)

This is where we create out posts on blog.

Let's follow "YEAR-MONTH-DAY-Category-Title.md" format when creating a file in the _posts folder.


## 5 assets
---
This is where we save the images we use in our blog.

Use this directory to load images in the blog.

## 6 _config
---
This is the most important environment variable settings file.

Type in our user name in the url section.

>url: https://jiehwan94.github.io

​title : This is where we name the title our blog

description : is a brief description of our blog

![그림18](/assets/img/Blog/githubpages/3-18.JPG)

We can leave the logo as-is.

We can change the author to what we have in _data/authors.yml file.

![그림19](/assets/img/Blog/githubpages/3-19.jpg)

paginate refers to the number of pages generated. Default is 5.

accent_image is the image of the sidebar

> assets/img/sidebar-bg.jpg

​

## 7 _about
---
This s where we describe ourselves.

I will place it at the top.

Let's compile and see the changed we made.

>bundle exec jekyll serve

After typing in the command above in the terminal, access the local server.
