## [GithubPages] 01.Intro

## Intro
It's been a while since I thought about migrating my blog from wix to github. I recently had a casual informational interview with one of my teammates from summer internship and heard that the team is now using git to collaborate and do version controls. Since I want to join the team after I graduate and if it's something I will eventually have to learn, why not start it now?

I can totally relate to people who want to create a github blog but are hesistant to make one, so the following episodes will cover how I was able to build my own github blog from scratch.

## Why I Blog
### First Reason
One thing I realized during my internship at EA and LINE was that everything was so well documented. The advantages of making good documentation are that:

- It allows collective intelligence, so that people can add comments and learn from each other.
- When we need to learn about previous projects or how a certain function works, a good documentation serves as a guideline.
- It avoids unnecessary waste of time by freeing people from the hassle of working from scratch.


### Second Reason
Our brain is not CPU, and we forget things.

I have had times when I had to google something again because I was lazy to put things together in the first place. This will add up to a significant amount of time throughout my career.

Why not organize it in my own words and use my blog as a wikipedia for my reference?

Plus, writing out what I did and learned on my blog will allow me to fully understand and review at the same time. Moreover, what's more fulfilling than having a feedback from someone that my documentation really helps?


### Reasons people write blogs
- To share knowledge
- Hobby/Interest in Writing
- Networking
- Digital Nomad lifestyle
- Fame/Popularity
- For making money
- To help others
- Stays in touch
- To satisfy your creative side
- Create a record
- To gain Knowledge


For whatever reason, they all serve as a good motivator for writing blogs

## Why Github Blog?
For the last few years, I have been posting blogs on wix, which allowed me choose a customizable designer-made template and add the features I need. Posting my projects was very easy. However, it was getting slower as I added more blog posts.

On the other hand, creating and making posts on Git is not as straightford as Wix. However, it pushes me learn something new skills which will benefit me one way or the other.

As the field of data science gets more mature and more candidates with degrees in data science graduate every year, I believe that the role of data scientists is also expanding to cover that of data engineers and software engineer, especially in small organizations.

Knowing how to use Git is becoming an essential skill and why not master it now?

## Advantages of Github Pages
I would not say that Github page is comfortable using. It's a hassle to set things up to even post and publish. But why should you use it?

I have searched some of its advantages.
â€‹
- Free,  but Fast.
- HTML/Markdown based posts.
- CSS/JS add ons.
- Easy to write.
- Works like my own database.
- Makes you learn Git, Ruby, etc.
- Collaboration.
- Provides more features than other blogs' frameworks.
- If you are building a project, it serves an optimal experience of syncing your project as a technical blog.
- Easy to add ads.
- Limitation of README.md (No Math symbols provided, No CSS)
